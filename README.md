# Mindset


### Basics 
- Confronted with the hard puzzles, one ten-year-old boy pulled up his chair, rubbed his hands together, smacked his lips, and cried out, “I love a challenge!”
- They knew that human qualities, such as intellectual skills, could be cultivated. 
And that’s what they were doing— getting smarter. 
Not only weren’t they discouraged by failure, they didn’t even think they were failing. They thought they were learning.
- Binet : IQ said that "designed this test to identify children who were not profiting from the Paris public schools, so that new educational programs could be designed to get them back on track"
A few modern philosophers . . . 
assert that an individual’s intelligence is a fixed quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react against this brutal pessimism. . . . 
With practice, training, and above all, method, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgment and literally to become more intelligent than we were before.
- forerunner Binet recognized,
  
> it’s not always the people who start out the smartest who end up the smartest.


### What are people with fixed mindset like ? 
- Believing that your qualities are carved in stone—the fixed mindset— creates an urgency to prove yourself over and over. 
If you have only a certain amount of intelligence, a certain personality, and a certain moral character—well, then you’d better prove that you have a healthy dose of
them. It simply wouldn’t do to look or feel deficient in these most basic characteristics.
- People with the thinking like
Will I succeed or fail? Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I feel like a winner or a loser?

### Ask yourself when you are thinking like a pussy ? 
> Why waste time proving over and over how great you are, when you could be getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look for friends or partners who will just shore up your self-esteem instead of ones who will also challenge you to grow? And why seek out the tried and true, instead of experiences that will stretch you?

### What is growth mindset ?
- The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when it’s not going well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset. This is the mindset that allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in their lives.
- People with the growth mindset were not labeling themselves and throwing up their hands. Even though they felt distressed, they were ready to take the risks, confront the challenges, and keep working at them.
> a special talent for identifying their own strengths and weaknesses.

### What does pussy mindset sound sound like to overpower the people with growth mindset ?
- What is truly amazing is that people with the fixed mindset would not agree. For them, it’s “Nothing ventured, nothing lost.” “If at first you don’t succeed, you probably don’t have the ability.” “If Rome wasn’t built in a day, maybe it wasn’t meant to be.” In other words, risk and effort are two things that might reveal your inadequacies and show that you were not up to the task. In fact, it’s startling to see the degree to which people with the fixed mindset do not believe in putting in effort or getting help.
